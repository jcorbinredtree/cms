RedTree Systems Content Management System

Depends on RedTree's framework, this repository should be grafted into the
site tree thusly:

/path/to/site/root/
  SITE/
    framework/
      lib/
        cms/     <-- here
    local/
      lib/
        cms/     <-- or here

It assumes that it can include things like "lib/cms/CMSConnector.php" and
access urls like http://server/site/root/lib/cms/css/bla, so if you've done
something really creative with your environment like fudge the include_path and
rewrite rules beyond what the standard framwork provides for, you can put it
whereever you'd like.
